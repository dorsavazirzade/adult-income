# adult-income
## Overview
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing individual incomes categorized as either `<= 50K` or `> 50K`. The goal is to explore the relationship between various features (e.g., education level, age, gender, and occupation) and annual income. The project involves cleaning the dataset, applying preprocessing techniques, and evaluating multiple classification models to determine the best-performing one.

## Tasks
**1.  Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

*  Utilize statistical analysis and visualization to understand the dataset.
*  Address missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
*  Apply feature encoding, scaling, and any other necessary transformations.

**2.  Model Development and Evaluation**

*  Explore and compare various classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
*  Report key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on a validation set.
